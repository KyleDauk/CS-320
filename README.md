## CS 320 Portfolio Reflection

### Ensuring Code Is Functional and Secure
I ensure my code is functional and secure by enforcing strict input validation, defensive programming, and comprehensive unit testing. I use JUnit tests to verify both valid and invalid inputs, including boundary conditions and exception handling, to ensure requirements are consistently enforced and defects are caught early.

### Interpreting User Needs and Incorporating Them Into a Program
I translate user and system requirements directly into code-level constraints and validate them through unit tests. Each requirement is traceable to specific test cases, ensuring the software behaves as expected and continues to meet user needs as it evolves.

### Approach to Designing Software
I design software with modularity, clarity, and testability in mind. I separate responsibilities between data objects and service logic, prioritize early validation, and treat testing as a core part of the design process rather than an afterthought.
